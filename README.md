# Assignment

Bank's software is mainly used to get insights on customer transactions. Within this assignment there is some backend software created to spin up a NodeJS service which serves a transactions file. Create an Angular application where a user can see their transactions in in list (timeline).

The requirements are:

- All transactions should be shown
- All transactions should be showed grouped based on date and ordered (newest on top)
- The information in the timeline should only show `otherParty.name` and the `amount` in EUR. (Be aware there is some USD as well, need to convert it based on the rate)
- When clicking on a transaction you should navigate to a detail page showing the more in-depth details
- It would be nice if there is some sort of styling (scss)

In addition to the code, consider other matters that you consider as part of your work.

## Installation and Usage

### usage

Made this application as a technical assesment for rabobank. The technical requirements are listed on top.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher, preferrably 20 which is the current supported LTS version.)
- Angular CLI

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/backend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

3. Start the backend service:
   ```sh
   npm run start:windows || npm run start:mac
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Angular application:
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```

### Accessing the Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

## Usage

The application consists of a welcome page with some news or information on it. And a transaction overview. where you can see your tansactions sorted by newest first. Clicking on a transaction will take you to the detailed information for the transaction.

## Deployment

- deploy to application using the output from `npm run build`, this will create a package ready for deployment in the project `dist` directory.
